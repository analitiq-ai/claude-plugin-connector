"""Render and publish versioned JSON Schema documents for Analitiq contracts.

Source of truth: Pydantic models in `analitiq.contracts.*`. The version is NEVER picked
by hand. `write` classifies the
structural diff against the committed `latest.json` and advances the version
itself (`--bump` raises it, upward only); CI's `bump-check` re-derives the same
floor and rejects any committed bump below it.

Output trees:
    Rendered into the committed tree, published to schemas.<domain> by the
    infra repo's Terraform (the bucket and CDN are not defined here):
        schemas/<resource>/{X.Y.Z}.json   (immutable per version)
        schemas/<resource>/latest.json     (mutable; mirrors current X.Y.Z)
        schemas/<resource>/index.json       (manifest: latest + versions)

Resources are declared in the `RESOURCES` registry below. Adding a schema is one
entry there + a `paths:` filter line in the CI workflow.

Subcommands:
    write       Auto-compute the next version (classify → advance) and write
                {version}.json + latest.json + index.json for one resource.
    check       Render every registered resource and exit 1 if any checked-in
                {version}.json/latest.json differs from rendered (CI gate).
    classify    Print detected severity vs. checked-in/base latest.json.
    bump-check  Exit 1 if the committed version bump (base→head) is below the
                detected floor or is a rollback (CI gate; replaces labels).
    list        Print registered resource names (one per line) — used by CI.

    masquerading as a brand-new resource (which would otherwise be classified
    as `major` and pass CI).
